# Composer Web UI

This is a proof of concept for a possible web interface for composer.

## Git it a try

* Checkout this repository via git.
* Install all dependencies via composer (`composer install`).
* Open a shell and `chdir` to the root directory of any project that has dependencies installed via composer.
* Run `bin/composer-webui` from this directory.
* Point your browser to `localhost:8000`.
